It is the presence of harmful substances in the atmosphere, dangerous not only to humans, but to other living organisms, the climate, and infrastructure. There are different types of air pollutants, including particulates, gases, and biological molecules, each emanating from an array of sources.
                          \nAir pollution is the cause of many diseases and allergies, which primarily affects the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Its extent is far reaching, including harm to animals and crops, and in extreme cases can render an environment uninhabitable. Natural processes generate air pollution, but human activity has eclipsed this since the industrial revolution.",

            'content' => "MapView is a web and mobile application which provides data visualisation of ambient air quality.
\nThe application collects raw air-quality measurements from Persium Pods and official reference stations in real-time, and then uses advanced air quality analytics, machine learning, and AI-based predictive models to process and forecast that data via an intuitive map display.
\nAt its most basic level, MapView is a free resource which empowers individuals & communities by providing real-time, reliable, and accurate information about their immediate air quality.
\nThis enables members of the public to make certain life choices that will improve their overall health, like choosing cleaner routes to work or school. It will also act as a tool that will educate and inspire individuals to make societal behavioural changes, and even has the potential to inform new home owners about the air quality of their prospective area or help manage smart-city traffic congestion zones.
\nAlthough MapView is a free resource, it also acts as a portal for the dissemination of air quality data. For those parties which are interested in digging deeper into such data, MapView is a paid subscription application. Here, interested parties can subsequently be given access to a wider range of analytical capabilities, such as access to historic data sets, statistics, graphing tools, comparison features, deeper AI-driven forecasts, and much more.

This is illustrated through ascending numerical index values, which correspond to particular ‘bands’ i.e. low, moderate, high, very high, etc. The higher the index value, the greater the level of air pollution, and the more hazardous it is to overall health.
\n
Different countries have different AQIs, with different categorisation systems and ways of calculating their pollution levels. This is in part due to different countries having different air quality problems and standards.

Nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide are referred to together as oxides of nitrogen (NOₓ). Growing evidence now points to Nitrogen dioxide’s adverse effects on the respiratory system, leading to increased symptoms of bronchitis, asthma, as well as reduced lung function and growth.
\n
Worse yet, NOₓ dissolves in water vapour to form smog and acid rain, which damages buildings, vegetation, and materials, contributing to the acidification of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It is also central to the formation of fine particles or particulate matter (PM) and ground-level ozone (O3), both of which are associated with adverse health effects (ranging from respiratory ailments to increased risk of cancer/heart attacks).

                    "content"   => "Ozone (O₃) can be good or bad for your health and the environment depending on where in the atmosphere it is located. O3 in the stratosphere is good, because it protects living tissue from ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Ground-level O3 is bad, because it can trigger various health issues. Ground-level O3 is formed through chemical reactions between pollutants emitted by cars, power and chemical plants, industrial boilers, refineries, and other sources chemically reacting in the sunlight.
\n
Ozone is one of the major components of photochemical smog and is a key health risk linked to breathing problems such as asthma, reduced lung function and respiratory diseases. Short term exposure to elevated concentrations of O3 can trigger reactions such as chest pain, throat irritation, coughing, and airway inflammation. Apart from its effects on human health, O3 also greatly damages vegetation, which in turn greatly affects crop yields and contributes to overall forest decline.

                    "content"   => "Particulate Matter (PM) are microscopic particles of solid or liquid matter suspended in the air. Sources of particulate matter can be natural or anthropogenic, such as combustion engines (both diesel and petrol), solid fuel (coal, lignite, heavy oil and biomass) combustion for energy production, as well as other industrial activities. They have impacts on climate and precipitation that adversely affect human health, in ways additional to direct inhalation.
\n
Airborne particulate matter is made up of a collection of inhalable and respirable particles of varying sizes and chemicals. Particles with a diameter of less than 10 micrometres (PM10), including fine particles less than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) pose the greatest risks to health, as they are capable of penetrating deep into the bronchi, where they remain, and cannot be dislodged through normal coughing action. The smaller the particle, the higher the health risk, due to their ability to penetrate deeper into the respiratory and circulatory systems.
\n
The effects of inhaling particulate matter that have been widely studied in humans and animals include asthma, lung cancer, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, premature delivery, birth defects, low birth weight, and premature death.

Exposure to SO2 affects lung function and the respiratory system, as well as irritation of the eyes. Inflammation of the respiratory tract from SO2 can aggravate chronic bronchitis and asthma, as well as the risk of infection.
\n
Sulphur Dioxide also combines with atmospheric water to form sulfuric acid - the main component of acid rain, which damages buildings, vegetation and materials. Furthermore, high SO2 concentrations in the air can lead to the formation of other sulphur oxides (SOx). SOx can in turn react with other compounds in the atmosphere to create secondary particulate matter (PM2.5).

It forms when carbon fuels are burned, either at too high a temperature or in the presence of too little oxygen. It is mainly emitted directly from idling vehicle engines and vehicle deceleration. Other sources are also from combustion in power station processes, biomass burning, as well as residential ovens, boilers, propane heaters and fireplaces.
\n
Carbon monoxide is particularly dangerous, as upon entering the bloodstream, it inhibits the body’s ability to carry oxygen to vital organs and tissues. Those who are particularly susceptible are infants, the elderly, and individuals with heart and respiratory diseases. Extremely high concentrations of CO can lead to death.

Hydrogen Sulphide can cause respiratory and cardiovascular irritation with early symptoms of eye irritation, as well as headaches, nausea or vomiting, even at low levels.
\n
Exposure to high concentrations can be extremely hazardous and lead to respiratory paralysis and unconsciousness, which rapidly induces death. Additionally, H2S is a major component of the sulphur cycle. It is oxidised in the atmosphere to form SO2, which then further forms SOx.

\n
Low concentrations of ammonia in the environment are normal and required for plant nutrition, however multiple issues arise as its concentration rises. This is due to its pollutive capabilities and its contribution to eutrophication and acidification of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
\n
Additionally, due to its corrosive nature, ammonia irritates the eyes, nose, throat and respiratory tract if inhaled in small amounts, and is poisonous in larger quantities. Moreover, NH3 forms secondary particulate matter (PM2.5), when combined with nitrates and sulphates in the atmosphere.

Although also found outdoors, due to incomplete combustion processes and from emissions in volatile industry by-products, VOCs are typically found indoors. Internal sources range from cleaners and disinfectants, air fresheners, carpets, wallpaper, pesticides, solvents, and tobacco smoke. Inhaling high concentrations of VOCs can cause difficulty breathing and nausea, as well as irritation to the eyes, nose and throat. Damage to the central nervous system and other organs has also been proven, with the most severe cases leading to cancer.
\n
Overall, the negative effects of VOCs have been attributed as ‘Sick Building Syndrome’. Additionally, some VOCs combine with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to form ground-level ozone (O3), which contributes to the formation of secondary particulate matter (PM2.5).
